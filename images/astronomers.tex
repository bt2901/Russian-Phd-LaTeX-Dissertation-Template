  \caption{
      An example illustrating why top-tokens based coherences may act badly in some cases.
      In the two presented pieces of text words related to the topic "Black Holes" are coloured (red~---~strongly related to the topic, pink~---~partially related).
      Text on the left is "good", it is actually about black holes.
      On the other hand, right text is nonsense.
      However, these texts are organized in a way to leave the top tokens of the topic "Black Holes" (red words) on nearly the same places in the text, i.e. if some of these tokens appeared in one words window on the left, so as on the right.
      Top-tokens based coherences would feel no difference.
      New intra-text measures should sense that something is "wrong" with text on the right, it is not connected with the topic.
